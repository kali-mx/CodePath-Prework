CodePath Prework Project

- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background

- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well












 Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

    Example App: Instagram
        Changing the background color of the messages screen
        Deleting old messages

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

## Project Idea: Workout Tracker
I would like to create a simple and intuitive workout on the fly planner/journal with a menu of common exercises. It must be quick and easy to setup and use. Here are some features I would like to make:

- graphical menu of common gym exercises to quickly select via checkmark to design/log a workout on the go.
- record workouts, reps, sets, weights, date, time and workout duration.
- record starting bodyweight and prompt user weekly for weight updates and track progress
- track progress of exercises, reps and weight increases/decreases via colorful easy to read charts.

## Notes

I found the tutorial very straighforward. I enjoyed using the Xcode app. The only challenge I enountered was setting up the GIF.  I found out along the way, Github blocks pushes of 100MB or more, so you must be mindful of keeping your GIF walk-throughs under this or they will not display.

## App Brainstorming
 
## 3 of my favorite applications:

1. Strava
- colorful, graphical display
- feature rich
- workout analysis and tracking

2. 10-Min Plank
- nice graphical demo poses to show proper workout form
- intuitive functionality
- simple and easy to use

3. Garmin Connect
- big, colorful display
- lots of tracking features
- easy and quick  

## Project Idea: Workout Tracker
I would like to create a simple and intuitive workout on the fly planner/journal with a menu of common exercises. It must be quick and easy to setup and use. Here are some features I would like to make:

- graphical menu of common gym exercises to quickly select via checkmark to design/log a workout on the go.
- record workouts, reps, sets, weights, date, time and workout duration.
- record starting bodyweight and prompt user weekly for weight updates and track progress
- track progress of exercises, reps and weight increases/decreases via colorful easy to read charts.
